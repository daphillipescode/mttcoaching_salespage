                  <p>Not exactly ‚Äì but that's a good thing. Let us explain.</p>
                  <p>Your session is handled by Enrico's top-performing student in the previous year ‚Äì personally trained, battle-tested, and handpicked by Enrico himself.</p>
                  <p>But why not Enrico?</p>
                  <p>Well, he's busy playing ‚Ç¨100K tournaments and battling the toughest regs in the world. That's because he's not a retired-pro-turned-coach.</p>
                  <p>There's a concept in learning called the "prot√©g√© effect" where teaching something forces you to understand it on a deeper level.</p>
                  <p>You spot holes you wouldn't have noticed on your own ‚Äì you tighten your thinking and sharpen your edge.</p>
                  <p>That's why Enrico coaches ‚Äì teaching forces him to constantly refine his strategies and make him a better, stronger player.</p>
                  <p>This means you're learning strategies that work RIGHT NOW, not recycled concepts from years ago.</p>
                  <p>So essentially, we've created something better than Enrico analyzing every hand himself: a coach who has internalized his live, pressure-tested methodology and can give you their undivided attention‚Ä¶</p>
                  <p>‚Ä¶While Enrico continues crushing high-stakes and evolving the system to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
